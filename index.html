          <h3>1. Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Suika Coin</strong> is a meme-driven token on the Sui
            blockchain, inspired by the fun, viral culture of internet memes. It
            aims to build a lighthearted community around the concept of sharing
            watermelon-themed memes, while still adhering to transparent,
            responsible tokenomics principles.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Suika Coin</li>
            <li><strong>Symbol:</strong> SUIKA</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Sui Network</li>
            <li><strong>Token Type:</strong> Sui Move-based fungible token</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>2. Total Supply</h3>
          <p>
            To enhance the meme culture of Suika Coin, we’ve chosen a large,
            memorable supply:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Total Supply:</strong> 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion)
              SUIKA
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This large total supply underscores the accessible, viral nature of
            the meme coin space and allows for a fun sense of abundance within
            our community.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Initial Mint & Distribution</h3>
          <p>
            The initial mint of Suika Coin is split into several tranches to
            meet community growth, liquidity, and marketing needs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Community Airdrop (40%)</strong><br />
              400,000,000,000 SUIKA are reserved to reward the early community
              members, contributors, and meme creators. Distributed through
              airdrops to encourage widespread adoption, with a short-term
              vesting period (e.g., 1–3 months) to promote engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity Pool (30%)</strong><br />
              300,000,000,000 SUIKA are allocated to liquidity pools on
              decentralized exchanges (DEXes) built on Sui. These tokens ensure
              smooth trading and help reduce price volatility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Team & Development (10%)</strong><br />
              100,000,000,000 SUIKA are earmarked to fund ongoing development,
              including website maintenance and future dApp integrations. Team
              tokens are locked for 6 months, with a linear release over 12
              months to align incentives with long-term success.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Marketing & Partnerships (10%)</strong><br />
              100,000,000,000 SUIKA will be used to grow brand awareness via
              promotions, contests, and collaborations. Funds are released as
              needed, with full transparency to the community.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reserve / Ecosystem Fund (10%)</strong><br />
              100,000,000,000 SUIKA are set aside in a secure multi-sig wallet
              for future expansions, grants to community developers, and any
              unforeseen opportunities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Token Utility</h3>
          <p>
            While Suika Coin’s primary appeal is its meme culture, we have plans
            to introduce additional utilities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Fun NFT Integrations:</strong> Holders may get special
              access to exclusive, watermelon-themed NFT drops in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Staking Rewards:</strong> Long-term, we aim to implement a
              staking mechanism for holders to earn additional SUIKA, subject to
              Sui’s Move framework capabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community Governance:</strong> We plan to introduce simple
              governance features (like community polls) so holders have a say
              in project direction.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Mechanisms & Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Burn Mechanism (Optional):</strong> Depending on community
              consensus, a small portion of transaction fees could be burned to
              reduce supply over time, encouraging a healthy market.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Anti-Whale Measures:</strong> If needed, transaction
              limits or wallet caps might be introduced to keep distribution
              democratic and protect against price manipulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Liquidity Management:</strong> The team may add or remove
              liquidity to maintain stable markets and manage slippage. Any
              major changes will be disclosed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Governance & Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            Although Suika Coin begins as a meme project, transparent governance
            is crucial:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Multisig Treasury Control:</strong> The Reserve/Ecosystem
              Fund is secured by a multi-signature wallet requiring approvals
              from a combination of core team members and the community.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Periodic Reporting:</strong> The team will provide monthly
              or quarterly updates on marketing expenditures, liquidity
              management, and any planned changes to tokenomics.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7. Roadmap</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 1: Launch & Initial Airdrop</strong>
              <p>
                Deploy the Suika Coin contract on Sui, distribute initial
                airdrops, and set up liquidity pools on DEXes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 2: Community Building & Marketing</strong>
              <p>
                Host meme contests, social media campaigns, and start forging
                partnerships or sponsorships to spread the word.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 3: Utility & Governance</strong>
              <p>
                Implement optional staking, initiate simple governance polls,
                and release transparency dashboards for tracking distribution.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion</strong>
              <p>
                Collaborate with other Sui-based dApps, potentially introduce
                play-to-earn mechanics, and explore cross-chain bridges if
                beneficial.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>8. Risks & Disclaimers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Meme tokens can see extreme
              price swings. Always do your own research.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regulatory Environment:</strong> Blockchain regulations
              vary by jurisdiction; Suika Coin issuance is not an investment or
              security offering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Guaranteed Returns:</strong> Suika Coin’s primary value
              proposition is community-driven meme appeal. There are no
              guaranteed returns.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>9. Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Suika Coin’s mission is simple: bring fun, watermelon-themed memes
            to life on the Sui blockchain while maintaining a fair, transparent
            structure for holders. By blending a whimsical brand with honest,
            open tokenomics, we hope to foster a vibrant, loyal community around
            Suika Coin.
